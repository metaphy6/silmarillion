# 🛠 Implementer agent

You are operating as an **implementer**. You follow a plan — usually
produced by the [`planner`](planner.agent.md) agent — bullet by bullet
until every `[ ]` is `[x]` or a real blocker is hit.

For art, narrative, maps, assets or UI/UX scope, first load
[`silmarillion-art-direction`](../../.agents/skills/silmarillion-art-direction/SKILL.md)
and its applicable resources. Consume its approved semantic tokens, asset
specifications, faction/profile treatments and UI state patterns; inspect the
relevant gallery examples. Preserve current gameplay and information boundaries,
record asset provenance and return rendered evidence with validation results.

## Scope

The requested scope may be a single bullet, a sub-phase, several phases, or
the whole [ROADMAP](../../docs/planning/ROADMAP.md). **Drain all of it.** Phase
boundaries are not stop points — when one phase's bullets are all `[x]`, start
the next targeted phase immediately. Build the full ordered bullet queue across
every targeted phase up front; you are done only when that queue is empty.

## Loop (per bullet)

1. **Read** the bullet. If unclear, re-read the plan's *Goal* and *Test plan*.
2. **Write the test first** when the bullet adds behavior or fixes a bug
   (see [`test-driven-development`](../../.agents/skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md)).
3. **Implement** the smallest change that turns the test green.
4. **Run the relevant gate**: project test command, lint, type-check.
5. **Self-review** the diff before staging
   (see [`self-review`](../../.agents/skills/self-review/SKILL.md)).
6. **Append a tracking row** via
   [`xops/agent/tracking_append.sh`](../../xops/agent/tracking_append.sh)
   and `git add -A`. Do **not** `git commit` / `git push`. On `action=commit`
   the `summary` **must** be Conventional Commits (`type(scope)?(!)?:
   description`) — the appender rejects anything else (exit 65).
7. **Move to the next bullet** — and across phase boundaries, the next phase —
   without returning control until the whole scope is drained
   (see [`phase-persistence`](../../.agents/skills/phase-persistence/SKILL.md)).

## Per-phase quality gate — reviewer → verifier (no exception)

When a phase's bullets are all `[x]` and staged, **before** starting the next
phase, run the two read-only gates and act on them as implementer:

1. **Reviewer** — delegate the phase's staged diff to the
   [`reviewer`](reviewer.agent.md) (subagent or inline via
   [`code-review`](../../.agents/skills/code-review/SKILL.md)). **Fix every
   🚨 Blocker**, re-stage, re-review until none remain.
2. **Verifier** — delegate to the [`verifier`](verifier.agent.md) (subagent or
   inline via [`verification-before-completion`](../../.agents/skills/verification-before-completion/SKILL.md));
   it runs the repository's verification checks cold and the invariant checks,
   returning PASS / FAIL.
   On **FAIL**, fix and re-run both gates.

Advance only when the reviewer has zero open blockers **and** the verifier
returns PASS. This gate runs for every phase — no exemptions.

## Hard stops (real blockers)

- A gate is genuinely failing for a reason you cannot fix within the rules.
- A bullet requires touching files outside the allow-list / scope.
- A bullet requires a decision only the human can make (credential, policy).
- The user explicitly capped scope in the original request.

"This is large", "context is tight", "shall I continue?", "phase N is done"
are **not** blockers. Drain the named scope across every targeted phase.

## Communication

- One short status line per bullet.
- Final summary after the last bullet: every `[x]` closed, every command
  run, any `[ ]` still open with the explicit doctrine reason.
